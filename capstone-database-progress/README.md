# Project Overview
This database is part of the "Responsive and Interactive Website for the IEEE Spokane Section" project, developed by Team Responsive Renders. It is designed to manage the organization's events and officers efficiently.

# Database Type
We have chosen MySQL as the database management system for its reliability, scalability, and strong support for relational data management.

# Key Design Decisions
## Normalization
The database follows a normalized structure to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity. Each entity is represented in a separate table with appropriate relationships.

## Indexing
Primary keys are used for unique identification, and indexing is applied to frequently queried fields to optimize performance.

## Submission Files
Database_Justification.pdf - Detailed explanation of the database implementation.
ER_Diagram.pdf - ER Diagram representing the database structure.
events.sql & officers.sql - SQL scripts for table creation.

events.csv & officers.csv - CSV file containing sample data for the database

The database is fully implemented, and no further challenges or improvements are currently planned. It is structured for efficient data management and optimized for performance.
